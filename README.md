## About This Project

**Image Recognition 5 Days Bootcamp** is a hands-on, project-based journey into modern computer vision. Built and tested entirely in Google Colab, this bootcamp covers:

- **Day 1:** Dataset download, MNIST & CIFAR-10 exploration, preprocessing, and visualization
- **Day 2:** Building and training a CNN from scratch (TensorFlow/Keras)
- **Day 3:** Data augmentation, batch normalization, and advanced model training
- **Day 4:** Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 on Cats vs. Dogs dataset (Kaggle)
- **Day 5 (suggested):** Model evaluation, ROC/AUC, deployment tips

## Why This Project?
- **End-to-End Workflow:** From data prep to model evaluation, this repo demonstrates a real-world ML pipeline.
- **Industry-Ready Practices:** Includes transfer learning, data augmentation, and efficient model evaluation.
- **Recruiter Value:** Shows experience with TensorFlow, Keras, Colab, Kaggle, GitHub, and modern ML best practices.
- **Portfolio Showcase:** Each notebook cell is annotated for clarity and reproducibility.

## How to Run

1. **Open in Colab:**  
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yourusername/your-repo/blob/main/Image_Recognition_5Days_Bootcamp.ipynb)

2. **Clone and run locally:**
